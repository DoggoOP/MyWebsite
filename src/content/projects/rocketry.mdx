## Overview

As a member of the Stanford Space Initiative Rocketry and Liquid Propulsion teams, I work across both high-power solid rocketry and liquid propulsion development. I earned my **NAR High Power Rocketry Level 1 certification** by designing, building, and successfully flying an I-motor rocket with motor ejection and parachute recovery.

## Level 1 Certification Flight

The L1 project involved end-to-end design and fabrication:

- Airframe sizing and stability analysis (static margin, CP/CG sweep) for the I-motor impulse class
- Nose cone and fin geometry CAD, fin can layup
- Motor ejection charge sizing for reliable apogee deployment
- Dual-event recovery (drogue at apogee, main at low altitude) with redundant altimeters
- Successful flight and recovery — L1 certification awarded

## Level 2 Dual-Stage Hot-Staging Vehicle

I am currently developing a **Level 2 dual-stage hot-staging rocket** — a more complex vehicle where the second stage ignites while the first stage is still attached, requiring careful timing and interstage design.

Key engineering work includes:

**FMEA** — systematic failure mode and effects analysis across avionics, pyrotechnics, staging sequence, and recovery systems to identify and mitigate single-point failures before flight.

**Chamber-wall heat-transfer analysis** — thermal modeling of combustion chamber wall temperature during burn, informing material selection and wall thickness for the motor case.

**Liquid propulsion plumbing** — as part of the SSI Liquid Propulsion team, I am designing propellant feed lines, valves, and a static fire test stand for a small bipropellant engine under development.
