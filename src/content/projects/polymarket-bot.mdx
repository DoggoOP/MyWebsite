## Overview

This bot autonomously trades weekly Polymarket prediction markets — starting with markets on weekly Musk tweet counts. It handles the full pipeline from data ingestion through trade execution, running on a scheduled Railway deployment with a live Next.js dashboard for monitoring positions and trade history.

## Data Ingestion

The ingestion layer pulls from multiple sources with fallback chains to handle API outages. For tweet-count markets, sources include direct API calls, third-party aggregators, and scraped fallbacks. Raw counts are normalized against a weekly-reset baseline so the model always operates on comparable quantities across different weeks.

All ingested data and derived signals are persisted in **SQLite with WAL mode** for concurrent read access from the dashboard without blocking the trading loop.

## Forecast & Risk Engine

**Distribution model:** The forecast blends a base distribution (fitted from historical weekly tweet counts) with real-time signal updates. A Monte Carlo simulation draws samples from the blended distribution and maps them to market outcome probabilities.

**Position sizing:** Kelly criterion with a fractional cap determines stake sizes. The Monte Carlo hedge layer identifies correlated outcomes and sizes offsetting positions to reduce variance without giving up expected value.

**Execution:** Orders are placed as GTD limits via the Polymarket CLOB API. The bot monitors open orders and applies ordered exits (take-profit → expiry) for each position.

## Infrastructure

- **FastAPI** backend handles scheduling, strategy execution, and serves the dashboard API
- **APScheduler** triggers the ingestion and trading loop on a weekly cadence aligned to market resolution times
- **Next.js** dashboard shows live positions, historical trades, P&L curve, and current forecast distribution
- **Railway** provides continuous deployment via GitHub Actions with environment variable injection for API keys
