## Overview

Skrunners is a campus autonomous drone delivery team operating under Stanford Student Robotics. As **Aerodynamics Lead and Systems Integration Engineer**, I am responsible for the aerodynamic design of the delivery UAV and the physical interfaces between the airframe, payload system, and ground infrastructure.

## Airframe Design

I CADed a **blended-fuselage fixed-wing UAV** sized to carry campus delivery payloads within the team's packaging constraints. The blended fuselage reduces wetted area and smooths the transition between the payload bay and lifting surfaces compared to a conventional tube-and-wing layout.

Key design considerations:
- Packaging the payload bay, battery, and avionics within the fuselage volume while maintaining acceptable CG travel across payload states
- Wing planform and airfoil selection balancing cruise efficiency with low-speed handling for autonomous takeoff/landing
- Structural layout for 3D printing and composite spar integration

## CFD & Stability Analysis

To accelerate the design loop without full CFD on every iteration, I applied a **physics-informed inference model** that uses a small set of CFD-evaluated anchor points combined with analytical thin-airfoil and lifting-line theory to predict:

- Static stability derivatives (Cmα, Clβ) across the design space
- Dynamic stability modes (phugoid, short-period, Dutch roll) from inferred aerodynamic coefficients
- Drag polar across the operating envelope

This hybrid approach delivers reliable stability estimates at a fraction of the computational cost of running full CFD on every geometry variant.

## Payload & Vertiport Interface

I designed the **payload interface** for reliable pickup and dropoff — a bottom-mounted bay with a latched door actuated by a servo, sized for the team's standardized delivery container. The **vertiport interface** defines the alignment guides, locking mechanism, and electrical contacts for autonomous charging between flights.
