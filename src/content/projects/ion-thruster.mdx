## Abstract

This work develops and validates simulation models for both gridded-ion and Hall-effect electric propulsion thrusters with the goal of deriving an analytic scaling relationship that maximizes thrust-to-power ratio. Models were implemented in Wolfram Language / Mathematica and validated against empirical performance datasets from the University of Michigan's PEPL (Plasma, Electric, and Propulsion) Lab. The resulting analytic model was peer-reviewed and published in the *Journal of High School Science* in September 2024.

## Methodology

Two thruster classes were modeled:

**Gridded ion thrusters** — particle trajectories through the ion optics (screen and accelerator grids) were simulated to predict beam current, specific impulse, and total thrust as a function of discharge voltage, beam extraction area, and propellant flow rate.

**Hall-effect thrusters** — a fluid-plasma model captures electron cross-field transport and ionization within the annular discharge channel, yielding thrust and efficiency curves across a sweep of operating points.

Both models were cross-validated against PEPL laboratory measurements across a range of operating conditions. Parameter sweeps over grid geometry, magnetic field strength, and propellant flow rate identified the regions of highest thrust-to-power efficiency.

## Results

- Derived an analytic scaling model demonstrating improved thrust-to-power ratio as a function of key geometric and operating parameters
- Simulation outputs matched PEPL empirical data to within acceptable margins across the validated operating range
- Published peer-reviewed results in the *Journal of High School Science* (Sep 2024)
